            About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Since 2007, Jaxis has been delivering outstanding custom software solutions that
            directly reflect our intense focus on interaction with our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open lines of communication are essential to reconciling delivered product with
            partner expectations. Consequently, we foster an environment of transparency and
            collaboration between our developers and our clients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Frequent delivery of software is a key part of that collaboration. It allows our
            partners to evaluate the most recent software iteration against specified requisites,
            and repeatedly compare those requisites to reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            We understand that fluid requirements are a result of constant software performance
            analysis. We welcome the challenge, and endeavor to implement a rapid response approach
            to client requests.</p>
        <p>
            We believe in simplicity of execution. A clear design picture follows open communication,
            and minimizes wasted time spent pursuing irrelevant or obsolete project objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            With such a diverse knowledgebase at our disposal, finding a subject matter expert
            (SME) is not a problem. Once identified, we center a given project on that individual’s
            expertise. Minimal learning curve, maximum productivity.</p>
        <p>
            Our most important metric is operational, streamlined software that meets or exceeds
            client specifications.
