            RadiantWave</h1>
        <p>
            RadiantWave provides innovative RFID-based solutions for the supply chain asset
            management and HealthCare verticals.
        </p>
        <p>
            In July of 2007, RadiantWave’s business horizon was rife with opportunity. Fortune
            500 companies were actively seeking out new methods of supply chain and asset management,
            and RadiantWave had the insight and expertise to assist them. To facilitate the
            aggressive expansion of their client base, RadiantWave was looking for a smart,
            nimble partner to help meet the demanding requirements of industry leading companies.
            Jim Dachelet, founder and CEO of RadiantWave, knew Jaxis was the right partner for
            the job.</p>
        <p>
            Jaxis’ first task was to modify and upgrade existing software. RadiantWave had already
            developed their key application, EdgeBase, in-house. EdgeBase is a middleware application
            that interfaces with clients’ supply chain or asset management UI, their host and
            legacy systems, hardware, captures data, and facilitates reader network management.
            Fundamental understanding and mastery of software design principles was an absolute
            must to fully appreciate and analyze such a multipurpose application. With that
            technical prowess, and always on the leading edge of industry technology, Jaxis
            quickly spotted and implemented several design and performance enhancements within
            EdgeBase. RadiantWave was now ready to fully embrace the myriad business opportunities
            in front of them.</p>
        <p>
            Working closely with such industry giants as Caterpillar, Raytheon, Peterbilt, Praxair,
            and the Department of Defense, Jaxis’ work and expertise is now integrated into
            the day to day operations of some of the largest, most demanding multinational corporations
            in the world. We custom tailored device drivers to meet the most exacting needs
            of RadiantWave’s clientele.
        </p>
        <p>
            With EdgeBase in shape, communicating seamlessly with clients’ hardware, and dozens
            of projects on the near horizon, RadiantWave and Jaxis are forging a solid, prosperous
            foundation for sustainable growth.</p>

            AW Mechanical</h1>
        <p>
            AW Mechanical Services is a leading, Houston-area industrial air conditioning contractor.
            Their expertise lies in large-scale air conditioning infrastructure service and
            repair.</p>
        <p>
            While providing top-notch industrial air conditioning service, AW Mechanical’s accounting
            system was in dire need of upgrading. Their current accounting application was written
            in dBase, and would only run under Windows 98 legacy systems. Unfortunately, the
            hardware infrastructure for their accounting software was failing rapidly. This
            required them to have to double key every accounting entry first into their dBase
            accounting system, then into QuickBooks. Jaxis is currently working on a custom
            application which, when completed, will interface directly with QuickBooks while
            continueing to support their custom work process. From complex software enhancements,
            custom driver development, or day-to-day business needs, Jaxis is a full-spectrum
            software solutions provider.</p>
