            Testimonials</h1>
        <p>
            Bret&#8217;s team of developers not only has a broad level of expertise, they also
            possess the professionalism and tenacity to get the job done. Any contractor who
            has worked with the Department of Defense will appreciate the attention to detail
            and patience needed to satisfy the DoD&#8217;s requirements. Changing specifications
            and operating environments are the norm, not the exception. Jaxis&#8217; adherence
            to the Agile software development model makes them the perfect partner when trying
            to accommodate the shifting needs of the government.
